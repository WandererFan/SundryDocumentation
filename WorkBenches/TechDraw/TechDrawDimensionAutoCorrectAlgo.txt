The dimension reference auto correct algorithm:

 when a dimension is created, the shape of each reference is saved, so in addition
 to the dimensionedObject + subElement reference, we also keep a Part::TopoShape copy
 of the reference. 

 when we later use that dimension, we check its references as follows:
 for each reference:
    if ref.currentGeometry == ref.savedGeometry:
        the reference points to the same geometry as before, so we
        so we consider this to be correct. same geometry, same index case.
        continue
    else:
        search all the source shapes for a subelement with the exact same
        geometry.  same geometry, different index case.
        newRef = searchForExactSameGeometry(ref)   geometry matcher
        if newRef:
            substitute the reference we just found in place of the old
            reference
            replace(ref, newRef)
        else:
            we don't have any geometry that is identical to our saved geometry.
            finding a match now becomes guess work.  we have to find the most
            similar geometry (with at least some level of same-ness) and use
            that to rebuild our reference.
            newRef = searchForMostSimilarGeometry(ref)  geometry guesser
            if newRef:
                replace(ref, newRef)
            else:
                we can't fix this
