The state of Dimension autocorrect

Control Parameters
- Mod > TechDraw > Dimensions > UseMatcher  defaults to true.  controls use of GeometryMatcher (exact match)
- Mod > TechDraw > Dimensions > UseGuesser  defaults to false.  controls use of GeometryGuesser (approximate match)


GeometryMatcher
- the trivial case where our reference geometry has the same shape and index works well
- matching Dimension References that have receive a new index number, but are otherwise unchanged, works well.
- the case where a dimension originally pointed to a subelement of a body feature which has now been deleted, works well.  In this case the entire body is scanned for matching geometry. 

GeometryGuesser
- the guess is currently using a match and score algorithm where a number of characteristics of model geometries are compared and points awarded for each match.
- if the point total is above a threshold, the reference and modeel geometry are considered to match.
- the current matching and scoring algorithm is not very robust.  It delivers false positive and false negatives along with the occasional correct answer.
- GeometryGuesser might benefit from a computer vision type approach for matching.
